# FilFi: A DeFi Protocol for Enhancing Filecoin Asset Liquidity

## Introduction

FilFi is a DeFi protocol dedicated to enhancing the liquidity of Filecoin assets. It provides users with fundamental services such as joint nodes, liquidity pledges, and computational power trading. Our goal is to create a permissionless liquidity market for the Filecoin community, to achieve fully decentralized DeFi, reduce the cost of trust, promote asset liquidity, and thereby accelerate the construction of the Filecoin network.

Building a Filecoin storage node is a complex process. On the one hand, it involves resources such as software, hardware, IDC, DC data, and requires professional technical services. On the other hand, constructing a storage node requires pledging a large amount of FIL, and there is a general lack of sufficient FIL in the market for sector encapsulation. FIL holders, hardware investors, and technical service providers need to collaborate to unleash maximum productivity. However, before the advent of smart contracts (FEVM/FVM), the scope of collaboration was small due to the lack of a reliable trust mechanism, and the elements of production were scattered, making it impossible to harness the synergistic effects of the entire community. Therefore, reducing the risk of FIL in circulation and increasing the transparency of the entire process becomes particularly important.

## Joint Node Services

The "Joint Node Services" of the FilFi protocol is the first storage node joint construction scheme in the Filecoin community that is 100% managed by smart contracts (FEVM/FVM). It provides core value from the following three aspects:

1. **Before construction**: It allows a wide range of participants to solve the shortage of pledges through "collective pledges".
2. **During construction**: The smart contract tracks the flow of FIL, enhancing the transparency of the construction process.
3. **After construction**: It automatically distributes Filecoin network incentives, eliminating human factors in performance.

## Design Goals of Joint Node Services

- **100% Smart Contract Management**: Fundraising period, encapsulation progress, distribution of profits - smart contracts take over everything, firmly enforce contracts, immutable, no human factors.

- **Utmost Transparency Throughout the Process**: 100% of pledges enter the smart contract. You can view the construction details of each FIL and the distribution record of each profit, eliminating all black-box operations.

- **Respect for the Value of Time**: If fundraising is unsuccessful, all pledges will be returned in full, and the value of the detention time will be compensated.

- **Completely Free for FIL Holders**: FilFi will not charge FIL holders any fees, nor will it share the profits of FIL holders.

- **Margin System Urges Service Providers to Fulfill Their Duties**: The innovative "subordinated pledge" system ensures that the interests of technical service providers are tied to the full cycle of the storage node.

- **Decentralized Governance**: FilFi is governed by the DAO community. It is built and shared in a decentralized manner, and the key parameters of the economic model are determined by a voting mechanism.
