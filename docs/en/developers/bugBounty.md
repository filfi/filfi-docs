# FILFI Bug Bounty Program

The security of the **FILFI DAO** system is crucial to the **FILFI** protocol. FILFI DAO will conduct internal and external audits, but given the constantly evolving ecosystem, there is still the possibility of bugs. We implement a bounty program to identify errors and bugs in the protocol infrastructure and smart contracts, rewarding any organization or individual that helps us make the system as robust as possible.

## Categories

To be eligible for a reward, the submitted issue must meet the minimum severity standard as described below. Approved submissions will receive FILFI community TOKEN rewards based on the severity category of the issue:

- **Up to 500 U** - Issues that may lead to user dissatisfaction or minor technical faults.
- **Up to 2,500 U** - Issues that may lead to a small loss of less than 0.1% of protocol funds, disrupt the protocol status, or cause serious user dissatisfaction or moderate technical faults.
- **Up to 5,000 U** - Issues that may lead to an immediate loss of 0.1% < X <10% of protocol funds or seriously disrupt the protocol status.
- **Up to 10,000 U** - Issues that may lead to an immediate loss of 10% or more of protocol funds or permanently damage the protocol status.

## Rules

Rewards will vary depending on the severity of the issue. In addition, you can increase the reward by providing high-quality information in the following areas: problem description, instructions to reproduce the problem, and solution (optional).

1. If you want to add more information about the reported issue, you can create a new submission referencing the initial issue.
2. The reward details for each activity will be determined by FILFI DAO. The terms and conditions of the bug bounty program are at the sole discretion of FILFI DAO.
3. Any interference with the protocol or client/platform service, whether accidental or not, while the issue still exists, will invalidate the submission and disqualify it from receiving a reward.
4. Public disclosure of the error will result in the submission being disqualified. Please read and comply with the responsible disclosure policy below, otherwise your report may not be eligible for a reward.
