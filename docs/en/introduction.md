**Introduction**
======

FilFi is a Defi protocol that promotes Filecoin asset liquidity, providing basic services such as federated nodes, liquidity pledges, arithmetic trading, etc. FilFi's goal is to create a permissionless liquidity market for the Filecoin community, achieve a fully decentralized Defi, reduce trust costs, promote liquidity, and accelerate the construction of the Filecoin network.

  

Building Filecoin storage nodes is a complex process, on the one hand, it involves hardware, software, IDC, DC data and other resources, and requires professional technical services; on the other hand, building storage nodes requires pledging a large amount of FIL, and there is a general lack of sufficient FIL for sector encapsulation.There is a need for collaboration between FIL holders, hardware investors, and technical service providers to unleash the maximum productivity. Before the emergence of smart contracts (FEVM/FVM), there was a lack of reliable trust mechanisms, small scope of collaboration, and fragmented production factors, which prevented the synergistic effect of the whole community. The construction task has a large time span and many links, so it is especially important to reduce the risk of FIL in the flow and increase the transparency of the whole process.

FilFi's "Joint Node Service" is the first 100% smart contract (FEVM/FVM) managed storage node joint construction program in the Filecoin community. It provides core value in three ways.

* Prior to construction, broad participation of builders to solve the lack of pledges through "pooled pledges".
    
* During construction, smart contracts track the flow of FILs to enhance the transparency of the construction process.
    
* After construction, automatically allocate Filecoin network incentives, eliminating the human factor in fulfillment.
    

Design goals of the "Union Node" service.

* 100% smart contract management. The smart contract takes over the fundraising period, encapsulation progress, and distribution of revenue, and it is firm, unchangeable, and free of human factors.
    
* Ultimate transparency of the whole process. 100% of pledges enter into smart contracts, you can see the construction details of each FIL, check the distribution records of each revenue, and eliminate all black-box operations.
    
* Respect for time value. If the fundraising is unsuccessful, the pledge will be returned in full and the value of the time spent will be compensated.
    
* Completely free of charge for FIL holders. FilFi will not charge FIL holders or share the earnings of FIL holders.
    
* Margin system urges service providers to exercise due diligence. The innovative "bad pledge" system ensures that the interests of the technology service provider are tied to the storage node for the full cycle.
    
* Decentralized governance: FilFi is governed by a community of DAOs, which builds and shares in a decentralized way, and decides the key parameters of the economic model through a voting mechanism.
